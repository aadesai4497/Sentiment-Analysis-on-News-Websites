22,Blog: The Lakhimpur Lesson - Hate Speech Finally A Liability For BJP?,"It could be easy to forget, amid the political white noise around the Lakhimpur violence, that the initial trigger was a hateful speech by a Union minister. The farmers crushed to death that fateful Sunday afternoon were amongst those who had gathered to protest comments made by Ajay Mishra, Minister of State for Home, in which he warned that he would ""sort (them) out in 2 minutes"" the agitators opposing the farm laws, now nearly a year old.While Mr Mishra's inciteful language is hardly new to Indian politics, the fact that it was made by a minister in charge of internal security, no less, and that he still remains in office indicates a dramatic shift under the present BJP dispensation when it comes to hate speech. And as the spiraling fallout from Lakhimpur demonstrates, that shift may no longer always play to the ruling party's advantage. Until not long ago, hate speech, though politically profitable, had to be deployed judiciously, especially by parties which had ascended to power. Not only is it bad form for lawmakers to make hateful comments that violate the law, the potential unrest it can trigger can make the ruling regime appear incompetent. This precarious tightrope was sought to be managed by dialing down the hate by those appointed to high office, and largely outsourcing divisive comment-making to fringe characters or outfits. Ruling parties in the past tried to maintain the slow drip of hateful rhetoric at the right dilution, enough to meet the desired outcome (deflecting public attention from misgovernance, firing up the base and so on), but without tipping the scales of hate so far that it could undermine their claims of providing stable governance.Under the present BJP, however, that precarious balance has been breached. Hate is no longer confined to the fringe.The slow drip is now a tidal wave. The galaxy of haters making anti-Muslim comments or threatening violence (or sometimes both) now routinely includes Union ministers, Chief Ministers, state ministers, MPs, MLAs, Governors and party bosses - the very men and women meant to ensure the observance of law.According to estimates by an NDTV project tracking hateful commentary by high-ranking political figures, 'VIP Hate' has witnessed an explosive jump of 790% in the first five years of the Modi government compared to the preceding five years of the UPA.And in Modi 2.0, it has gotten worse: the average monthly hate speech by high ranking figures has risen by 80% compared to Modi 1.0. Of the total of 315 hateful comments counted by us during the past seven years, 264 or 84% of all comments have come from top BJP functionaries versus 16% from high-ranking members of other political parties.Because of the BJP's other break from convention - its 'strongman' approach where mistakes are rarely conceded publicly - virtually none of the saffron party's 'VIP Haters' have faced legal or other consequences, even as their words have led to disastrous repercussions for others, Lakhimpur being the latest instance.This volcano of high-level, unpunished bigotry so far has done little to hurt the BJP's political prospects; in fact, it could be argued that the party's ever-ascending electoral graph parallels its outsize contribution to India's hate wave (despite the obvious contradiction of members of a government claiming to be tough on law and order routinely breaking the law themselves).The most egregious example of this was the Delhi state election of 2020, in which Home Minister Amit Shah, in charge of India's internal security, and also the reporting authority for Delhi's police force, directed - and participated in - one of the most communally-charged campaigns by the BJP in recent memory. Leader after leader - reportedly at Mr Shah's behest - drew aim at the multiple sit-in protests against the CAA/NRC that had sprung up across the city. A leader who now serves as Union Minister chanted ""Desh ke Gadaron ko Goli Maro Saalon Ko (shoot the traitors)"" from the stage. A BJP MP warned that the protestors of Shaheen Bagh would rape and kill the sisters of Delhi's citizens. Mr Shah himself asked voters to press the button for the BJP with such anger that it ""should send a current to Shaheen Bagh"", dislodging the protestors who had gathered there.While this hateful campaign did not result in electoral success - Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party won the capital resoundingly - the BJP ended up with a higher-than-expected 39% voteshare, which several analysts ascribed to a 'hate bump'. The Delhi campaign and result however also provided a glimmer of how unchecked, unpunished hate speech can backfire for the ruling regime. When the capital city, unsurprisingly, erupted into communal violence two weeks after the virulent campaign ended, the Home Minister was nowhere to be seen. Instead, National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, tasked with overseeing India's wider strategic-security concerns, had to play a sort of mohalla peacemaker, walking through the riot-hit lanes of North East Delhi to calm tempers between Hindus and Muslims.It speaks to the BJP's stranglehold over the public conversation that the backlash from Mr Shah's temporary vanishing act in the middle of the worst rioting the national capital has seen in decades did not last long, nor significantly dent his 'Mr Law and Order' image.But with Lakhimpur, the BJP is fighting a more tenacious political fire ignited by its latest VIP Hater. (It did not help that in neighboring Haryana, the BJP's Chief Minister ML Khattar, another constitutional head, added his own scoop of oil to the flames, urging a crowd of listeners to take ""tit for tat"" action against protesting farmers ). Varun Gandhi, the BJP MP from UP's Pilibhit, which neighbours Lakhimpur, has been public with his criticism of his party's handling of the imbroglio. (Mr Gandhi himself was filmed making virulent speeches ahead of the 2014 elections in which he threatened violent retaliation against Muslims.) Others in the party have chosen to express their disquiet anonymously - one nameless BJP functionary reportedly told The Indian Express that as a result of the mishandling of Lakhimpur, 'raita phail gaya hai (the mess has spread)'.Could this, then, finally be a lesson to the BJP, that when hate is let out of the bottle, it becomes impossible to ensure that it will only be directed at politically-convenient targets at politically-convenient times? It seems highly unlikely that Minister Mishra (or Chief Minister Khattar) would have risked making threats of violence against a crucial constituency like farmers in election season were it not for the extraordinary climate of impunity towards hate enabled by their party superiors.Initial indications suggest otherwise. Two days after the violence, in blissful indifference to multiple conflicts of interests, Mr Mishra got to present his defence not at a local police thana but at North Block, to his boss, Home Minister Shah. In effect, two high functionaries tasked with maintaining national law and order, and belonging to the same political party, confabulated over how to contain the fallout from the involvement of one of them in a cycle of hate speech and cold-blooded murder. If anyone has been penalised by the party, it is Varun Gandhi, who, along with his mother, has been dropped from the BJP's national executive.There are indications that the BJP may yet act against Mr Mishra; even if it does, it would be naive to assume a dramatic shift in the party's approach to hate speech. It has too many first-hand dividends from the politics of hate to significantly scale back. But even the rare concession of dropping a hate-spewing Union Minister, if indeed that happens, suggests that Lakhimpur may be the first real test of the political limits of the BJP's new normal, of brazening out the consequences of hateful incitement by high-level government figures.PromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com(Sreenivasan Jain is Group Editor, NDTV)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

30,Will not let Assam become another Kashmir: Amit Shah on NRC,"In the light of the deadly terror attack on a CRPF convoy in Jammu and Kashmir, BJP chief Amit Shah while addressing a rally in Lakhimpur on Sunday raked up the issue of National Register of Citizens (NRC),  and said that the Centre “will not allow Assam to become another Kashmir”. “We will not allow Assam to become another Kashmir. That is why we have brought NRC (National Register of Citizens). We will deport each and every infiltrator with the help of NRC. We are committed to that,” he said. Promising that the sacrifices of the of the jawans would not go in vain, Shah firmly stated that the BJP-led NDA government is not ready to compromise on the security issue unlike its predecessor Congress. Calling it a ‘cowardly act’ by Pakistan-backed terrorists, Shah said that they would not be spared at any cost. “This cowardly act was done by Pakistani terrorists. Their (jawans’) sacrifices will not go in vain, because there is no Congress government at the Centre.

It was being made to appear as if it was only for Assam and other parts of the Northeast. “It was not only for Northeast, but for all refugees in the entire country. The way demography is changing in Assam, without the Citizenship Bill, the people of the state will be in big danger,” Shah said. 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

31,"Priyanka Gandhi’s first acquisition: a ‘vote-cutter’, off-and-on Congress ally in Uttar Pradesh","ONE of the first major decisions of Priyanka Gandhi Vadra as Congress general secretary in-charge of eastern Uttar Pradesh was alliance with the Mahan Dal — a party that the Congress has kept turning to in the past few Lok Sabha polls in the state, despite its poor electoral performance. Since it was conceived in 2008, the party that claims influence among “non-Yadav” OBC voters in over a dozen Lok Sabha constituencies in western UP has not won a single Lok Sabha or Assembly seat. It has the capacity to play the spoiler though — a fact that the Congress, kept out of the SP-BSP alliance, seems to be banking on. The support of non-Yadav OBCs was believed to have been key to the BJP’s win in the 2014 Lok Sabha and 2017 Assembly polls in UP. The Mahan Dal was formed by Keshav Dev Maurya, who was earlier associated with the SP and BSP, and lost the 2004 Lok Sabha elections as an Apna Dal candidate from Jaunpur. In 2009, the Mahan Dal contested its first Lok Sabha polls, in tie-up with the Congress, fighting from Aonla and Mainpuri seats. In Aonla, it got 56,233 votes while the difference of votes between the winner BJP and the runner-up SP was just 7,861 votes. In SP bastion Manipuri though, the Mahan Dal had a dismal show, getting only 1,187 votes. In 2012, the Mahan Dal contested the Assembly elections alone, fielding candidates in 74 seats and getting 6.83 lakh or 0.90 per cent of the total votes polled in the state. In the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, the Congress again had an alliance with the Mahan Dal, along with the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD). While eight seats were given to the RLD, three seats were given to the Mahan Dal, including Etah, Nagina and Badaun. The party ended up getting about 22,774 votes on these west UP seats. In the 2017 Assembly polls, the Mahan Dal contested on 14 seats alone, getting 96,087 or 0.11 per cent of the total votes polled in the state. All its 14 candidates lost their deposits. The Congress fought in alliance with the SP. The party had contested on two seats in the recent Assembly polls in MP too, and was runner-up in Jatara and at fourth place in Jaura. Maurya’s son and the state president of the party’s youth wing, Kishan Maurya, said the party has support among non-Yadav OBCs such as Kushwahas, Shakyas, Sainis and Mauryas, in Amroha, Hathras, Aonla, Badaun, Etah, Bijnor, Bareilly and Lakhimpur seats. “The Mahan Dal could not win any seats but the Congress benefited from our alliance in 2009. The situation in 2014 was different,” said Kishan, hinting at the Modi wave. On the alliance for the coming Lok Sabha polls, he said, “We will accept whatever the Congress offers.” He said the alliance would also be on for the 2022 Assembly polls. Maurya added that it was the Mahan Dal’s support that had helped the SP win the Noorpur Assembly by-election last year. “Earlier our maximum impact was on the BSP. Later, most of these sections (the non-Yadav OBCs) came out in support of the BJP, so the Mahan Dal will now cause damage to the BJP.” About how it can damage any party, Maurya was candid. “If larger alliances like the BJP’s or SP-BSP’s take us in, we are strong. Otherwise we cut votes… If we can’t cut votes, who will give us a share?” 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

32,How the Assamese are saving orchids through social media and cultivation,"In January 2003, two days before Bohag Bihu, Khyanjeet Gogoi, trekking in the forests bordering Dibru Saikhowa National Park, was picked up by the United Liberated Front of Assam (ULFA) — at the time the most dreaded militant outfit of the Northeast. Held hostage in a secret “jungle” camp on the Assam-Arunachal Pradesh border, the militants interrogated Khyanjeet: “Why are you here? What are you looking for?” “Orchids,” the 23-year-old replied. It was an answer no one expected. Three days later, the slightly bemused ULFA cadres left Khyanjeet on the banks of a river; he was free to make his way home. He was looking for a rare species of orchid at the park. Needless to say, those orchids were never found, but the quest continued. Since 1994, he has been travelling only in search of orchids. Over the years, he has recorded 395 species in Assam alone, discovered 35 new ones, named three himself and cultivated several more in his backyard in the small town of Rupai in Upper Assam’s Doomdooma, where he teaches biology at a local high school. Today, he has many monikers in Assam: the orchid expert, the orchid whisperer, the orchid man, and is often called by the government to identify rare species. In Assam, the kopou phool, or the foxtail orchid, the pinkish-white flower that blooms in April and resembles a fox’s tail, was accorded the status of state flower in 2003. It has been, since time immemorial, linked to Assamese culture (as a symbol of fertility, merriment, love and affection) and is most conspicuous during Magh Bihu (the festival that heralds spring in Assam) — not just on trees, but also neatly tied to the head of a Bihu dancer. “For the longest time, I didn’t even know they were called orchids. As a child, I would recognise them as kopou phool,” says Khyanjeet, who first saw these flowers not adorning a Bihu dancer’s head, but lying by the side of the road. “After using them, people would just throw these flowers away, and I — attracted by their appearance — would often collect them,” he says. He remembers, how as a student of botany in Sivasagar, he found no books on the subject in his college library, save for one chapter in one text book. “That is when I decided I should write to a book on orchids in Assam,” he recalls. In 2010, he published the Wild Orchids of Assam. To date, it’s arguably the only full-length book in English on Assam orchids. In India, there are 1331 species of orchids, found in the Eastern Himalayas including Northeast region, Western Ghats, and eastern part of western Himalayas. “But the Northeast remains an orchid hotspot (all the seven states) with 72 per cent of total orchids found in India,” says Khyanjeet. However, simultaneously, as these flowers bloom, they are fast wilting and disappearing too. The reasons are many: deforestation, soil erosion, over grazing. While some traders do have proper trade licenses, majority of orchid trade, which is in part with China, is illegal. In 2015, Assam inaugurated the three-hectare Kaziranga National Orchid and Biodiversity Park belonging to Akhil Gogoi’s Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti, which was promoted as a space for conservation. Today, it has 500 varieties of wild orchids, and is a tourist attraction. A life member of Orchid Society of India, and the founder member of the Orchid Society of Eastern Himalayas, Khyanjeet met 26-year-old Ankur Gogoi at a youth festival in 2015. A dhul player of a local Bihu band in his hometown at Tengapukhuri, Ankur recounts, “Right before one of our performances, we realised we didn’t have any orchids for the girl dancers to put in their hair. But luckily, we came across someone who was cultivating close to 100 orchids in their home.” That made him think — “If they can, why can’t I? In 2010, I started getting orchids home — with the little knowledge I had, I began growing them. I would tie them up to the big mango and betel nut trees in my yard with a string. Soon I had twenty varieties.” Khyanjeet taught Ankur how to culture the flowers, how to propagate them, and make more seedlings. For example, it wasn’t enough to just “bring orchids home”. “Orchids thrive only in certain climate — yes, they are easy to cultivate, but they are as easy to kill too,” Ankur was told. Through social media, in 2017, Ankur connected to other orchid lovers in Assam, from Dhemaji, Lakhimpur, Golaghat, and Tinsukia. “These were teachers, businessmen, students, tea planters,” says Ankur. A social app called the ‘Orchid Group of Assam’ now has 53 members. They formed The Orchid Society of Assam, now a formally registered society, with the singular aim of conservation of orchid species in the state. “The kopou phool is the state flower. If we can protect the rhino, our state animal, why can’t we protect the kopou phool too?” says Mithu Gogi, a tea planter who is a member of the group and has about 7,000 kopou phools growing in his backyard. “But it is an expensive proposition,” he admits. There are no government funds for its conservation. “We spend our own money only because we love it,” says Ankur. 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

It was an answer no one expected. Three days later, the slightly bemused ULFA cadres left Khyanjeet on the banks of a river; he was free to make his way home. That trip, remembers Khyanjeet, was futile. “I was looking for a rare species of orchid that was apparently growing wild at the national park.” Needless to say, those orchids were never discovered, but the quest continued. For Khyanjeet, ever since 1994, has been travelling only in search of orchids. Over the years, he has recorded 395 species in Assam alone, discovered 35 new ones, named three himself and cultivated several more in his backyard in the small town of Rupai in Upper Assam’s Doomdooma, where he teaches Biology at a local high school. Today, the 38-year-old has many monikers in Assam: the orchid expert, the orchid whisperer, the orchid man, and is often called by the government to identify rare species. “If my friends invite me for a holiday, the first question I ask is: is there a forest near by?” says Khyanjeet, over the phone from Rupai, “Because, if there are forests, then there are definitely orchids.” A THRIVING ILLEGAL TRADE In Assam, the kopou phool, or the foxtail orchid, the mauve-ish flower that blooms in April and resembles a fox’s tail, was accorded the status of state flower in 2003. It has been, since time immemorial, linked to Assamese culture (as a symbol of fertility, merriment, love and affection) and is most conspicuous during Bohag Bihu (the festival that heralds spring in Assam) — not just on trees, but also neatly adoring the head of a Bihu dancer. “For the longest time, I didn’t even know they were called orchids. As a child, I would recognise them as kopou phool,” says Khyanjeet, who first saw these flowers not on a Bihu dancer’s head, but lying by the side of the road. “After using them, people would just throw these flowers away, and I — attracted by their appearance — would often collect them,” he says. Later, as a student of Botany, he learned that the kopou phool was just one kind of orchid, and in the thickly-forested areas of Assam alone, there were many, many more, growing wild. In India, there are 1,331 species of orchids, found in the Eastern Himalayas including the Northeast, Western Ghats, and the eastern part of Western Himalayas. “But the Northeast remains an orchid hotspot with 72% of total orchids found in India,” says Khyanjeet. In Assam, orchids are found in the tropical wet forests of Lakhimpur, Tinsukia, Dibrugarh, Dhemaji, Kokrajhar and Karbi Anglong. However, simultaneously, as these flowers bloom, they are wilting and disappearing too. The reasons are many: deforestation, soil erosion, over grazing — “But also, a thriving illegal trade,” adds Khyanjeet. While some traders do have proper trade licenses, majority of orchid trade, which is in part with China, is illegal. In 2015, Assam inaugurated the three-hectare Kaziranga National Orchid and Biodiversity Park belonging to peasant activist Akhil Gogoi’s Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti, which was promoted as a space for conservation. Today, it is a tourist attraction, and has 500 varieties of wild orchids. Yet, despite these efforts, there are several species (like the Blue Vanda, or the Vanda coerulea that resembles a lady’s tresses, or the beautiful Paphiopedilum hirsutissimum popularly known as the Lady’s Slipper) that would thrive in Assam at one point but are no longer found. Khyanjeet, who helped setting up the biodiversity park at Kaziranga, and later moved away, feels that orchid conservation needs stronger laws in place. “The Wildlife Protection Act states that no one can trade anything (](living / dead plants or animals) from the forest— but when it comes to orchids, no one pays heed to that,” says Khyanjeet. While the illegal trade with China is not a secret, no one has really investigated it. “I suppose one could but one needs to find people who are interested in orchids too,” he says. It was only last month that he did. THE ORCHID WHATSAPP GROUP OF ASSAM For the longest time, Khyanjeet, who “stays away from social media”, wanted to form a society with like-minded orchid lovers from Assam. He was already a life member of Orchid Society of India, and the founder member of the Orchid Society of Eastern Himalayas — “But we never had a dedicated society in Assam,” he says. In 2015, at a youth festival in Sivasagar, he met 26-year-old Ankur Gogoi, who claims he found his life’s calling when he least expected to — as a dhul player of a local Bihu band in his hometown at Tengapukhuri in 2010.  “Right before our performance, we realised we didn’t have any orchids for the girls to put in their hair. But luckily, we came across someone who was cultivating close to 100 orchids in their home.” That made Ankur think — “If they can, why can’t I? In 2010, I started getting orchids home and began growing them.” Orchids can grow on the ground, on rocks and even on other trees and plants. “I would tie them up to the big mango and betel nut trees in my yard with a string. Soon I had twenty varieties.” It was only when he met Khyanjeet, who Ankur considers his mentor, that the latter feels he truly learned about orchids. “He taught me a lot: how to culture them, how to propagate them, how to make more seedlings,” Ankur recalls. For example, it wasn’t enough to just “bring orchids home”. “Orchids thrive only in certain climate — yes, they are easy to cultivate, but they are as easy to kill too,” Khyanjeet had told Ankur, who would post tidbits of information from these lessons, along with beautiful pictures on Facebook. “I started sharing these tips on social media in the hope to find other people who liked orchids,” says Ankur. Turns out many did. Through Facebook, beginning late 2017, Ankur connected to other orchid lovers in Assam — enthusiasts from Dhemaji, Lakhimpur, Golaghat, and Tinsukia. “These were  teachers, businessmen, students, tea planters — both men and women, young and old — who wanted to learn more about the orchid simply because they liked it,” says Ankur. Soon, a Whatsapp group was formed. “I called it the ‘Orchid Group of Assam’, and it now has 53 members.”  Khyanjeet, who doesn’t own a smartphone, is not on it. AN EXPENSIVE PROPOSITION On December 29, 2018, three days before the year ended, and almost 12 months after they connected on Facebook, the orchid lovers met for the first time at the Silapathar Science College in Dhemaji. “It was Khyanjeet da’s idea. He said that since we were already talking on Whatsapp, why not do it face to face,” says Ankur. The Orchid Society of Assam is now a formally registered society with the singular aim of conservation of orchid species in the state. While Ankur is the Secretary, Dr Jitu Gogoi, who teaches Botany at the Silapathar Science College is President. And then there are members like Mithu Gogoi a tea planter, who, in his backyard in Jorhat, has about 7,000 kopou phools growing, since 2013. It isn’t a commercial venture but a hobby he indulges in with sound reason. “The kopou phool is the state flower. If we can protect the rhino, our state animal, why can’t we protect the kopou phool too?” Mithu asks. The society, now one month old, effectively wants to create awareness about the flower: to teach people its value, its worth, and how to take care of it. “You might buy it, but if you don know how to culture it in proper labs,  then there is no point,” says Ankur. He now has 350 species growing at his home in Tengapukhuri. “But it is an expensive proposition,” he admits. There are no government funds for its conservation and even the few books available on orchids are expensive. “We do it spending our own money only because we love it,” says Ankur. As does Khyanjeet. He remembers, how as a student of Botany in Sivasagar, he found no books on the subject in his college library, save for one chapter in one text book. “That is when I decided I should write a book on orchids in Assam,” he recalls. In 2010, he published the Wild Orchids of Assam, based on his years of research. It is arguably the only full-length book in English on orchids in Assam. 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

34,"Lakhimpur Kheri: Girls found dead were strangulated, say police","Two minor girls, who were found dead at Jheera Bojhi village in Lakhimpur Kheri on Friday evening, were strangulated to death, police said. Autopsy report confirmed that they were killed, but ruled out any sexual assault or rape, police added. “Though the families claimed that they found the bodies hanging from an electricity pole in a field, we do not have any evidence to prove that. The investigation is on,” Additional Superintendent of Police, Lakhimpur Kheri, Ghanshyam, said. By the time the police reached the spot, they found the bodies lying on the field, he added. “The postmortem was conducted by a panel of three doctors and its report stated that the death occurred due to strangulation. No injury marks have been found on the bodies. They have also ruled out any sexual assault. A murder case has been lodged against unidentified people on the complaint of the girls’ families,” said Ghanshyam. Police said that they are also not ruling out honour killing angle. “We have come to know that the girls used to go to the field everyday to graze their cattle and return home in the evening. On Friday, they had left home at around 2 pm. No other family members were with them. Around 5.00 pm, when the girls did not return, their families started looking for them,” the ASP said. “The families claim that they spotted the girls hanging from the electricity pole in the field in the evening. They brought down the bodies and informed the police. We have come to know that the locals had last spotted the girls in the field at around 4.00 pm,” Ghanshyam added. The field where the bodies were found is located around 500 metre from the houses of the victims. “The victims’ slippers were found lying a few distance away from the electricity pole though there is no sign of scuffle at the spot. So far, the victims’ family denied having any enmity with any person,” said Pasgwan station house officer, Satendra Singh. 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

35,Kin of those killed in Assam movement return mementos,"In a symbolic protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, the families of 76 people killed during the Assam Movement in the 1980s on Wednesday returned mementos awarded to them by Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal in 2016. The families gathered at the office of All Assam Students’ Union (AASU) — which had spearheaded the six-year movement — and then marched to the DC office in Guwahati to return the mementos. The Assam Movement started in 1979 against illegal immigrants in the state. The six-year agitation concluded with the signing of the Assam Accord in 1985, which stated that all those who came from Bangladesh after March 24, 1971, have to be deported, irrespective of their religion. In December 2016, Sonowal had disbursed one-time ex-gratia of Rs 5 Lakh and a memento to the kin of each of the 855 people killed during the movement. The families did not return the monetary reward. Rajen Deka, the president of an association representing the families, told The Indian Express, “The memento is the main thing. We are returning it in protest against the Bill. The Bill will destroy the people of Assam and rob us of our dignity in our own land. It will protect illegal foreigners.” The Bill amends the Citizenship Act, 1955, by relaxing the eligibility rules for a section of immigrants — belonging to six minority (non-Muslim) religions, Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians, from Afghanistan, Bangladesh or Pakistan — in getting Indian citizenship. Opposition parties and several outfits have claimed that the Bill is a “threat” to the indigenous communities of the region and that it violates the Assam Accord. Rita Barua, sister of Lusan Barua, who was killed during the movement, said, “We are returning the award because the Sonowal-led Assam government has not kept its promise to making Assam free of illegal foreigners. It is a shame how the sacrifice of the martyrs is being insulted.” Bhubon Bora, a relative of K Deka, who was killed during the movement, said, “Around 855 people were martyred to save Assam from illegal foreigners. But if the Bill is passed, then the movement’s efforts and the Assam Accord will be nullified. What is the use of the keeping the memento from this government if they are bringing in a Bill which is against the Assam Accord?” Dipti Bora of Morigaon district, who lost her elder brother during the movement, said, “This Bill protects the foreigners by violating the Assam Accord. We protest against this Bill.” Sidheswar Pator of Morigaon and Krishna Borpatragohain from Lakhimpur, who lost relatives in the movement, echoed the same sentiments. “This Bill will be very bad for Assam. Illegal foreigners will be legalised through this Bill,” Pator said. 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

36,"Uttar Pradesh: Four farmers killed by stray bulls while guarding their crop, says police","Four farmers had died after being allegedly attacked by stray bulls while guarding their crops in separate incidents over the last 48 hours, police said Monday. The cases were reported from Lakhimpur (1), Gonda (2) and Badaun (1). “Deen Bandhu (50) of Mudha village was watching over his crops on Sunday morning when he saw a bull in his farm. When he tried to chase the animal, it attacked him and he collapsed on the ground. Some local residents ran to save him but it was too late. While the bull escaped, the farmer was reported brought dead at a local hospital,” said Paan Singh, station house officer (SHO) of Neemgaon police station. Ujhani Circle Officer (CO) in Badaun Bhushan Verma said 30-year-old Ram Ladait was killed by a bull in Mugarra village on Saturday. “Ladait was at his farm when he was attacked by a violent stray bull. Local residents said the bull repeatedly attacked him while he kept trying to escape. The farmer died on the spot. Villagers tried to chase the bull but it got away,” added Verma. Meanwhile, another farmer identified as 52-year-old Jagannath was killed in Gonda’s Belanwa village after a bull gored him with its horns.

37,UP-turn: The Arithmetic and Chemistry of SP-BSP alliance,"On January 20, hundreds of Samajwadi Party workers led by former party MP Ramkishun rushed to Baburi Police Station in Chandauli district bordering Varanasi to demand an FIR against BJP MLA Sadhna Singh for her derogatory remarks against BSP chief Mayawati. To those looking to see if the SP and BSP could put behind 23 years of animosity to work together, this incident coming eight days after they announced an alliance was an encouraging sign. Ramkishun, who won narrowly in 2009 against the BSP candidate before trailing behind the BJP and BSP in 2014, may have had more immediate concerns — like a ticket with BSP support — but in Battle Uttar Pradesh 2019, now wide open with its new tie-ups (SP-BSP) and new sign-ups (Priyanka Gandhi), the BJP would have taken note. Five years after seeking a vote for change, both at the state and in the Centre, it is the BJP, with Ram temple back on the table, that is fighting the fatigue factor. And the Opposition that, seemingly, has a spring in its step. However, can the SP plus the BSP and its presumed plus one, the Congress, subtract enough from the BJP’s tally of 71/80 seats in 2014 to decide who rules Delhi? UP’s 80 Lok Sabha seats will decide who forms the next government at the Centre. SP and BSP coming together after 25 years marks a major political realignment, but while this seems to be working with their traditional vote banks, what will prove crucial is whether they can extend this beyond, especially when BJP, despite some attrition, seems to be holding on to its hardcore supporters. As for the other claimed game-changer, the entry of Priyanka, Congress can expect some gains in pockets where it won in 2009. Or will that traditional political wisdom against alliances hold true again — “Neta mile hain, janta nahin… Dal mile hain, dil nahin (It’s the leaders, parties who have joined… not the public or hearts).” The swathe of green wheat fields dotted with patches of yellow of the mustard crop bears a calm contrast to the political churning and calculations that have begun in all major political, economic and even cultural centres since Mayawati and Akhilesh Yadav announced the BSP-SP alliance on January 12. But there is no doubt in the minds of the staunch vote banks of the two parties, across 11 Lok Sabha seats—Mohanlalganj, Barabanki, Dhaurahra, Sitapur, Kheri, Shahjahanpur, Hardoi, Misrikh, Unnao, Akbarpur, Fatehpur — comprising 58 Assembly segments, that The Sunday Express travelled through. These Lok Sabha constituencies near capital Lucknow have a mix of population, including a sizeable chunk of Dalit votes. “If the SP and BSP are in alliance, I will vote for the BSP. Why not?” asks an elderly Lal Bahadur Yadav in Bhuhera village in the Barabanki Lok Sabha seat. With the sowing operations for the Rabi crop over, there are many from this village lazing around the roadside tea stall where he is sitting. It’s not only they who echo Lal Bahadur but Yadavs across the 11 constituencies. “I will vote for the gathbandhan (SP-BSP). I have no objection voting for the bicycle (the SP’s election symbol). It will get deposited with the elephant (the BSP’s symbol), isn’t it?” says Rambujh, a Dalit in his late 30s at Lakhimpur Kheri town, voicing what the BSP’s traditional voters repeat across the constituencies. This bonhomie, for now, appears untainted by both the Guest House episode of 1995 — with Mayawati at the receiving end of a violent attack by SP supporters — and the allegations of misuse of the SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act against Yadavs during Mayawati’s regime. The faith in this arithmetic is bolstered by the three-on-three success rate the gathbandhan has had with the tie-up experiment so far — in the bypoll contests for Gorakhpur, Phulpur and Kairana Lok Sabha seats in 2018. Basking in the winter sun at Ganj-Muradabad in the Bangarmau Assembly segment of Unnao Lok Sabha seat, Raju Khan harks back to the results in the Gorakhpur and Phulpur seats, vacated by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and Deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya respectively. “The BJP lost both seats. It lost MP, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh despite a relatively small share of Muslim votes there. They will lose very badly here,” he says. The BJP argues it won’t be that simple. “Except in UP and, to a lesser extent, Karnataka, the arithmetic does not appear to be any significantly different from 2014. The whole emphasis in these two states is on caste coalitions. Vote transferability in such caste coalitions is not so simple. Local chemistries react differently. Many of these combinations end up as theoretical propositions,” senior BJP leader Arun Jaitley wrote on January 21. However, Jaitley too agreed that the BJP was looking at a tough climb: “The BJP and NDA have to be prepared for a battle for 50 per cent vote in a direct fight contest.” That BJP calculation comes not just from the realisation that there will be at least some accretion of SP and BSP votes. It also comes from the knowledge that the party will lose some votes since the 2014 Modi wave. Most people who say they will vote for the BJP in 2019 say they had also voted for it in 2014 and the 2017 Assembly polls. But, across social groups and age gaps, many who had voted for the BJP last two times say they would prefer the SP-BSP this time. “I voted for Modi in the Modi lehar (wave). Now it is not there,” says Dhirendra Pasi of Dharnar village in the Sitapur Assembly segment of Dhaurahra Lok Sabha constituency. This support that Narendra Modi’s popularity had earned the BJP even among communities such as Yadavs and Dalits — widely associated with the SP and BSP — had been a big factor in the party’s crushing win of 2014 in UP. In the absence of the Modi wave, many of these voters are drifting away, citing reasons varying from local grievances to the BJP forgetting Ram temple till now. The 2014 results show that this double whammy, of SP-BSP votes coming together and the attrition among BJP voters, could make the BJP vulnerable in theoretically 53 of the 80 Lok Sabha seats won by it (excluding 5 won by the SP). In 36 of these seats, the SP and BSP had together polled more votes than the BJP. In 17 others, the SP, BSP votes had trailed behind the BJP’s by less than 10 per cent. BSP, SP supporters cite the bypoll wins in 2018 when the two parties came together. The BJP lost despite having won the three seats in  2014 with more than 50 per cent of the votes — Gorakhpur (51.8 per cent), Phulpur (52.43 per cent) and Kairana (50.4 per cent). The BJP’s hopes of Akhilesh’s rebel uncle Shivpal Yadav confusing the SP voter base seem misplaced too. Across constituencies, he is not  even a consideration for the Yadavs. In face of this, the BJP is banking on the public’s past experience of such disparate alliances. “The Opposition’s alliance is not based on any ideology. The electorate knows that they will flop, like the Opposition flopped in 1989 and 1996 (at the Centre). Their slogan is ‘Modi  Hatao’, our slogan is ‘Garibi Hatao’,” says UP Law Minister Brajesh Pathak. BJP leaders also claim that the party will more than make up the gap created by its declining votes, by the votes it will gain among people  who have benefited from its policies. They cite Ujjwala (LPG cylinders), Saubhahya (power connections), PM Awaas Yojana (housing),  Swachh Bharat (toilets) and the recently launched health insurance scheme. Says UP Power Minister Shrikant Sharma, “Modi has made a grand alliance with the three crore poor people of the state. We derive our  strength from beneficiaries of our welfare initiatives.” Ultimately, the BJP hopes, when it comes down to the wire, it is this Modi factor that will kick in. Writing last week, Jaitley said, “If a second term for PM Modi is the issue, it is advantage BJP. The election will be more presidential.” This edge that Modi enjoys, over an Opposition that hopes to leave the PM tussle for later, is clearest among the upper caste voters. Listing the Modi government’s achievements, Jitendra Dubey, a Brahmin in his 40s at Bilanda village in Fatehpur Lok Sabha constituency says,  “Corruption has gone down, law and order has improved, there is no discrimination on caste lines.” Incidentally, the BJP appears to have made no visible gain from the recently announced 10 per cent quota for EWS among the general  category. If the upper castes make only a passing mention of it, among the beneficiaries of existing reservations who could have borne some grudge, like SCs/STs/OBCs, the 10 per cent quota — yet to be implemented on the ground — is so far not a talking point. Neither, insists the BJP, is Priyanka Gandhi Vadra. Since the Congress announced her formal entry into politics, from an area in which falls Modi’s constituency, the party has made no bones about the fact that it hopes to pit its debatable trump card against the BJP’s. “Priyanka  Gandhi’s one speech in Rae Bareli had made Arun Nehru lose his election in 1999. Her campaign in Bellary got Sushma Swaraj packing. That is why there is panic among other parties,” says UP Congress spokesperson Akhilesh Pratap Singh. Playing down Priyanka’s effect, Shrikant Sharma says, “She has been in politics for long. Yuvraj (Rahul Gandhi) has failed, that is why they  had to get Priyanka.” Many believe, and the BJP asserts, that Priyanka would end up hurting the SP-BSP. The Congress won 21 Lok Sabha seats in the state in 2009, and Priyanka’s presence could bolster the Congress as a serious contender here — cutting into the BSP-SP numbers.  Among those debating between the SP-BSP and Congress now are the Muslims. In Ganj-Muradabad town in Unnao Lok Sabha constituency, Karimullah, who is in his 60s, asserts, “We want the Congress at the Centre. If the Congress looks in contest, we will vote for the Congress.” Ruling out that Priyanka’s entry will hurt them, SP MLC Udaiveer Singh says, “She was in politics earlier too. Our social base, organisation and agenda are committed and clear.” He also insists that the BSP and SP deliberately kept the Congress out of the alliance. “Our agenda is to ensure justice for Dalits, backwards, oppressed…,” says Udaiveer Singh. “Our alliance is sufficient to champion this.”
The Others But, maybe not. Where the BSP-SP is coming up short is making that crossover from its own support base of Yadavs, Dalits and Muslims to attracting votes from other groups. In the caste-determined electoral loyalties of UP, the 2014 Modi wave was as much about the votes the BJP mopped up among  communities outside the politically dominant Brahmins, Rajputs, Yadavs, Jats and Jatavs — most crucially the Extremely Backward Castes  (EBCs). While their euphoria for the BJP appears to have waned, it hasn’t shifted to the SP-BSP over Modi either. During a discussion in Mohammdi Assembly segment of Dhaurahra constituency, as voices are raised for and against Modi, Shyamu Prajapati, Sushil Sharma and Rakesh Pal, belonging to EBC groups, are muted in their support for the BJP. At Moharkalan village in Mohanlalganj Lok Sabha constituency, Maykhulal Pal and Mahesh Kumar Parajapati don’t denounce the BJP either, despite being troubled by the stray cattle menace.  They may still be watching how the politically better organised communities shape the poll battle-field in coming days. The BSP-SP is counting on the fact that it is early days yet, with just 15 days since the alliance was announced, and hope that EBCs would  be among the undecided voters who will move towards them eventually. Claiming to have crossed the hump of ticket distribution already — announcing the alliance, Akhilesh and Maya said they would contest 38 seats each — one of the ways the BSP and SP hope to woo EBCs is by offering them seats. The leaderships of both the parties are believed to have already identified the seats each would contest, and the prominent leaders who could pose a problem. The SP leadership, in particular, has begun patient talks to keep them from rocking the boat. Meanwhile, one issue that SP, BSP supporters have caught onto is the stray cattle problem — several districts have been seeing protests by farmers. However, while this has given SP-BSP workers a talking point, BJP supporters are not entirely convinced. Jitendra Singh, a Rajput in his 30s at Shivrajpur village in Misrikh Lok Sabha seat, says “After all, these animals have not been let loose by the government. We have left our own cattle.” Others point out that, even if late, the Yogi government has realised the need for more cattle shelters. It also remains to be seen whether the cattle issue will remain relevant come polls. By then, the Rabi crop would have been harvested. 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

38,Meet Assam’s Padma Shri winners: surgeon Illias Ali and innovator Uddhab Bharali,"Two persons from Assam — one who has been tirelessly working to curb the rising population in the state and the other who is known for his ingenious innovations — have been awarded the Padma Shri, the fourth highest civilian award given in India. DR ILIAS ALI — SURGEON AND POPULATION EXPERT Since 1993, Dr Illias Ali has travelled on bullock carts, motor bikes and country boats from tea gardens in upper Assam to the hills of Karbi Anglong to the char chaporis (riverine islands of the Brahmaputra), convincing people of the poorest, most backward regions to adopt family planning and birth control measures. “Many years ago, I read the book The Population Bomb by Paul Ehrlich. It said, if we don’t diffuse this ‘population bomb’, the earth will be destroyed. That left an impact on me,” said Dr Ali, who is also the Chairman, Population Foundation North East. Dr Ali says that the only way India can progress is if the country prioritises the issue of population. “Like Indonesia and China, even India has to take serious measures,” said Dr Ali, who is also known for speaking out against polygamy and child marriage. “But the journey so far has been rife with hurdles. Especially among the Muslim community in Assam, who consider children as ‘Allah’s daan’,” said Dr Ali, who then went from village to village, quoting verses from the holy Quran. “I told them what is the point of giving birth, if one does not have the resources to take of the children.” On receiving the Padma Shri, Dr Ali said, “I am happy the government has recognised this war I have been fighting. Now the responsibility is to cater to the population which exists. To ensure that they have basic food, education and are healthy and happy.” UDDHAB BHARALI: INNOVATOR Even if it’s something as mundane as deseeding a pomegranate Lakhimpur’s Uddhab Bharali’s motto is to make the job simpler. The innovator, who finished his 150th innovation on January 25, is known for his ingenious contraptions: garlic peeling machine, paddy thresher, cane stripping machine, brass utensil polishing machine, passion fruit juice extractor, trench digger, to name a few. But the 57-year-old has also dedicated his life to serving Persons with Disabilities — apart from making tools (for those who require “assistance beyond a wheelchair”) that can be used by them, under his financial care are seven families, who face such difficulties. “Apart from that, 25 families — who are extremely poor — are under my care, and I run a destitute home too,” said Bharali. This drive to do philanthropic work is rooted in Bharali’s own childhood — in 1988, he dropped out of engineering college in Chennai because his family, under a debt of 18 lakh, couldn’t afford to support his education. That is when he came back to Lakhimpur and got involved in the innovation sector. “Many people start their journey from ‘zero’. I started mine from minus 18 lakhs,” he said, admitting that he has always been a somewhat “eccentric person” since childhood. “I would always ask what people considered the most absurd questions.”  On receiving the Padma Shri, Bharali says it is an honour that such an issue is getting national recognition. “Very few people are in the line of innovation. It gives me inspiration to keep working,” said Bharali, who received President’s award for Grassroots Innovators in 2009. Bharali now runs UKB Agrotech in his hometown in Lakhimpur, a machine design and research centre. “Today I might have a lot of commercial orders but I dedicate and prioritise my time for social issues. Helping these people makes me feel good. I might die a poor man, but at least it will be for a rich reason.” 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

39,"Priyanka Gandhi in charge: East Uttar Pradesh a Congress stronghold, political hotbed","East Uttar Pradesh, where Congress’s newly appointed general secretary Priyanka Gandhi will take charge on behalf of the party, has been, over the years, a Congress stronghold in the state. In 2009, the party won as many as 21 seats from the region. East UP will also be the political hotbed in the state in the coming elections. It is home to the constituencies of Prime Minister Narendra Modi (Varanasi), Home Minister Rajnath Singh (Lucknow), and the region around Gorakhpur, the home turf of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. But some of the Congress’s best results have also come from East UP. In 2014, when the Congress nearly folded up in UP amid a Modi wave, the only two seats it retained – Sonia Gandhi’s Rae Bareli and Rahul Gandhi’s Amethi – is in this region. In that sense, party insiders said, Priyanka will have her task cut out: to wrest some of those seats back for the party. On the other hand, most of West UP, where Jyotiraditya Scindia will be in charge, comprises constituencies where the party is not very strong – the reason it had left 11 seats for alliance partners Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) and Mahan Dal in 2014, and two for Samajwadi Party (SP) even without an alliance. Uttar Pradesh is usually divided into four regions: western, eastern, central and Bundelkhand regions. In this divide, eastern UP, or Purvanchal, has 26 Lok Sabha constituencies abutting Bihar and Chhattisgarh. But the Congress has divided the state into two parts, meaning roughly 40 seats each in East and West UP. With the SP and BSP having this time announced that they will not put up candidates in Rae Bareli and Amethi, the Congress may leave some seat for the BSP near the national capital in West UP. Of the 11 constituencies where the Congress polled more than 1 lakh votes in 2014, nine are in East UP. Besides Rae Bareli and Amethi, Congress leader P L Punia polled 2.42 lakh votes, while in Kushinagar R P N Singh got 2.8 lakh votes against the winning BJP candidate. In Mirzapur, next to Varanasi, Congress’s Lalitesh Pati Tripathi got over 1.5 lakh votes even though he came third (Anupriya Patel of Apna Dal, an NDA partner, won). In Lucknow, then Congress leader Rita Bahuguna Joshi, now with BJP, finished second, polling nearly 2.8 lakh votes against Rajnath Singh. In Allahabad, Nanda Gopal Nandi, who later joined BJP and became a minister, received over 1 lakh votes, although he finished fourth. In Faizabad, former state unit chief Nirmal Khatri got over 1 lakh votes. In 2009, out of 21 seats the party won in UP, 13 were from this region: Rae Bareli, Amethi, Maharajganj, Kushinagar, Sultanpur, Pratapgarh, Faizabad, Shravasti, Unnao, Barabanki, Bahraich, Dhaurara, Domariygan. Several candidates who won from this region became Union ministers, including R P N Singh (Kushinagar), Beni Prasad Verma (Gonda), and Jitin Prasada (Dhaurara). Punia, who won from Barabanki reserved constituency, was made chairman of the National Commission for Scheduled Castes. Missed development bus While the region has suffered from lack of development, and many areas of East UP are fighting diseases such as encephalitis, districts such as Sonbhadra, comprising Robertganj Lok Sabha constituency, are also plagued with Left-Wing Extremism. The Tarai belt of districts such as Shravasti, Bahraich, Lakhimpur Kheri and Balranmpur, etc, are hit by floods almost every year when Nepal releases excess water following heavy rainfall in the monsoon months. From the economic point of view, the region’s economy depends largely on migrant workers — people from districts such as Jaunpur, Gorakhpur, Ghazipur, Azamgarh, etc have gone out to Mumbai, Delhi, Gujarat – even Saudi Arabia — in search of jobs. Following implementation of demonetisation, this region also suffered the most, as migrant workers in large number were forced to return home after work dried up and small unit downed shutters. Some of these families, it is said, are yet to emerge from that downturn.

40,Kashmir still a challenge due to Pakistan’s destabilising activities: Rajnath Singh,"Kashmir is still a challenge due to destabilising activities by Pakistan, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh said in Lakhimpur Kheri on Monday. He was talking to mediapersons after inaugurating the administrative building, residential block and officers’ mess at the SSB sector headquarters. “Kashmir is still a challenge due to destabilising activities by neighbouring Pakistan. However, the Army, the CRPF, the J&K police and intelligence bureau men are acting in better coordination,” he said. Speaking about Naxal incidents, the home minister said they had dropped by 50 per cent during the last four years. Extremist violence in northeastern areas saw a decline of 80 per cent, Singh said. Lauding improvements made on the internal security front, he said, “No major terrorist incident had taken place in India during the last four-and-a-half years (of the Narendra Modi government).” Singh said the country’s economy today was counted as the world’s fastest growing. “By 2030, the Indian economy would rank among top three economies of the world,” he said. “The Modi government has launched the world’s largest universal health care scheme Ayushmaan Bharat which has benefitted 7.5 lakh people so far,” Singh said. 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

41,Citizenship Bill protests continue in Northeast,"A ‘Black Day’ was observed across the Northeast on Saturday following a strike call by North East Students’ Organisation, an umbrella body of student groups in the region, to protest against the crackdown on those demonstrating against the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2016 in Tripura and Manipur this week. Sporadic demonstrations continued in parts of Assam and a shutdown was observed in Tripura Tribal Areas Autonomous District Council (TTAADC) on Saturday. Black flags were raised by student bodies across the region, including at the headquarters of the All Assam Students’ Union (AASU) in Guwahati. A sedition complaint was lodged against Assam minister Himanta Biswa Sarma over alleged communal remarks. AASU advisor Samujjal Bhattacharya said, “Black Day was observed as a mark of protest against four incidents: the police crackdown on protesters in Tripura, police attacking an ambulance carrying the injured in Tripura that day, disallowing the NESO leadership to visit injured students at a hospital in Khumulwng in Tripura yesterday and police firing tear gas shells on protesters in Manipur yesterday.”
Several organisations had protested against the Bill in Imphal on Friday, following which police fired tear gas shells. West Imphal SP Jogeshchandra Haobijam said that at least two people were injured in police action and were discharged after first aid. “Everything is calm as of today,” Haobijam said. In Tripura, Upendra Debbarma, advisor to Twipra Students’ Federation and vice-chairman of NESO, said, “Today has been peaceful and a highly successful strike.” In Assam’s Silchar, authorities at Assam University on Saturday imposed restrictions on protests on campus without prior approval. This come a day after BJP leader Pradip Dutta threatened Assamese-speaking students of Barak Valley to bar their admission in the university. Dutta took back his comments later after drawing sharp criticism. Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti activists lodged a complaint of sedition against Assam minister Himanta Biswa Sarma at Laluk police station in Lakhimpur district. A senior police officer said, “They have given the complaint saying the minister made controversial communal statements. A case has not been registered yet. We have to investigate…” 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

42,Citizenship Amendment Bill: northeast unifies for bandh for the first time,"With the Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) exiting the BJP-led coalition, things have come to a boil in Assam over the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill 2016, which was cleared by the Union cabinet earlier on Monday. In protest, the entire Northeast is observing an 11-hour bandh on Tuesday from 5 am to 4 pm. “This is the first time in ten years that the All Assam Students’ Union (AASU) is calling for a bandh,” said AASU General Secretary Lurin Jyoti Gogoi. “We don’t mean create inconvenience for anyone through bandhs. But the situation is so grave that we have been left with no other alternative,” he added. This is also the first time since independence that the entire Northeast region will observe a unified bandh, he said. The North East Students’ Union (NESO) — the umbrella student body representing all the states — has also called for the bandh across seven northeastern states, which is being supported by the AGP, the Congress and 30 other ethnic organisations from Assam. The decision was taken right after PM Narendra Modi’s rally at Silchar on January 4, where he stated that the Bill will be passed by the Parliament soon. The main grouse of the opposers is that they fear the Bill — which seeks to amend the Citizenship Act 1955 by granting citizenship to Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, Christians and Parsis from Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Pakistan — will destroy Assam, which has been grappling with the issue of ‘illegal immigration’ for decades now. The Bill effectively allows anyone belonging to the above-mentioned groups to seek citizenship in India, as long as they have entered Indian before December 31, 2014. The opposers also feel this contradicts the ongoing update of the National Registry of Citizens (NRC) which takes into consideration March 24, 1971, as the cut-off date for citizenship in Assam. In May 2018, a Joint Parliamentary Committee was sent to Assam to take stock of the opposition and support with regard to the Bill. While the bandh came into effect at 5 am on Tuesday, in parts of Assam, riled by protests over the past week, things had already come to a standstill as shopkeepers in Jorhat reportedly pulled shutters down early Monday evening. Across the state, protests gathered momentum over the past week. A huge congregation — of intellectuals, students, activists, scholars, politicians as well as citizens — gathered in Guwahati on Monday afternoon. Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti (KMSS) members also stripped and staged a protest in New Delhi. On Sunday, a group of women protestors — having no political affiliation — reportedly thronged the BJP state headquarters in Guwahati demanding the Bill be scrapped. In Dibrugarh, Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal was greeted with black flags by the KMSS when he came to attend an Asom Sahitya Sabha function. Since early Tuesday morning, people have been pelting stones at moving vehicles and trucks in several districts across Assam. A number of vehicles, including private vehicles and auto rickshaws, have been damaged by protestors in Azara, outskirts of Guwahati. Agitators across Assam are carrying demonstrations by burning tyres and voicing slogans in Baksa, Lakhimpur, Dhemaji, Tezpur, Golaghat. “We have been protesting for months now — not just in Guwahati, but in the remoter corners of the state. Tomorrow’s bandh is called by the AASU and we are extending our support wholeheartedly,” said a KMSS member. The student bodies from Manipur, Mizoram, Meghalaya, Tripura, Arunachal Pradesh and Nagaland have also asked people of their respective states to observe the bandh in “a bid to save their indigenous communities from extinction”. Total shutdown has been observed in these states too. “We protested a lot; we protested on the road; we came to Delhi, spoke to the Prime Minister, the Home Minister, the JPC…but it is unfortunate that the Centre didn’t listen to us,” said AGP President Atul Bora, addressing the media after announcing their exit from the BJP government in Assam. “If a government doesn’t give importance to a democratic protest, then there is really no choice for us,” said Gogoi. “We have got support from all constituent student unions of the NESO for the bandh tomorrow. We have requested through various social media forums for all the Assamese to stand by our decision. This is the only way we can save our culture.” 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

43,A bridge across the Brahmaputra,"Bogibeel, the longest rail-road bridge of India, spanning nearly five-km across the Brahmaputra, was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on December 25. It will link Dibrugarh with North Lakhimpur district of Assam and parts of eastern Arunachal Pradesh. The event, marked with much fanfare, was hailed by many as a historic milestone in the development of the Northeastern region.
One could wonder, what is so special about a bridge that has taken 16 years to complete? Should we really be rejoicing over the completion of an infrastructure project, which has missed its timelines several times? The brouhaha over a bridge may even invite disdain in the drawing rooms of Lutyens Delhi. But for thousands of poor people, living in eastern Assam and Arunachal Pradesh, this is truly a momentous occasion. Sixty eight years after being ravaged by a devastating earthquake and the ensuing floods, Dibrugarh is reclaiming its lost glory. It used to be a thriving centre of the plantation industry during the colonial times. For the people of the region, it remains a hub of higher education and medical treatment. However, for decades, the only recourse for people to cross the Brahmaputra would be to chug along for over an hour, in a diesel propelled ferry, which would also carry their vehicles and goods, even cattle. Crossing the river could be a costlier proposition than flying between Mumbai and Goa. All this is set to change. Commissioning the bridge has reduced the journey time across the river to less than five minutes, bringing relief to people living in these remote parts. The single biggest factor which has shackled the development of the Northeast region is the absence of robust connectivity. A maze of river systems across Arunachal Pradesh, with their confluence in the Brahmaputra, have posed an enormous challenge. The commissioning of Bogibeel, therefore, is a harbinger of hope. The bridge’s significance goes well beyond the succour to local residents. It has the potential to infuse economic dynamism in the region and provide opportunities for the expansion of tourism, industrial development and trade. Bogibeel must be viewed alongside other infrastructure developments in neighbouring Arunachal Pradesh. The iconic Bhupen Hazarika bridge over the Lohit river was commissioned recently by the prime minister. A 7.5 km long bridge over the Dibang river was dedicated to the nation a few days ago. The Trans Arunachal Highway, has seen considerable progress, especially in the eastern part of the state. An airport has been commissioned at Pasighat, barely two hours away from Dibrugarh. One of the most pristine parts of Arunachal Pradesh has now become accessible to the rest of the world. This could give a fillip to tourism, given that the region has abundant wildlife and is ideal for river rafting and angling. However, an imaginative roadmap of tourism development, promotion and branding needs to be crafted, centred around the region’s tribal ethos. Dibrugarh lies at the heart of a crucial oil and gas axis in Assam, given its proximity to Digboi and Duliajan oilfields. Further east lie the Kharsang gas fields and Kumchai oilfields of Arunachal Pradesh. The district also has significant coal deposits. There are more than 200 tea factories in Dibrugarh. Commissioning of the bridge has raised the prospects of industrial development and opportunities of productive employment for the youth, especially in the mining and plantation sectors. Bogibeel is the gateway to the historic Stilwell Road, which connects Ledo in Assam to Kunming in China, passing through Myanmar’s Kachin state, via Arunachal Pradesh. The 1,800 km long route was used for transporting arms to the Chinese by the Americans during World War II. Its revival for trade is well within grasp now. The route could well become the centrepiece of the ambitious Act East Policy. It would follow the Asian Highway (AH )14 and reach Kunming along AH3. The Chinese stretch has a six-lane highway, while the Indian side in Arunachal Pradesh has a two-lane highway. Infrastructure in Myanmar, of course, would need to be strengthened and the land customs station at Nampong in Arunachal Pradesh revived. Trade could revitalise economic activity, in what is otherwise one of the most backward parts of Arunachal Pradesh. From a strategic standpoint, movement of troops has become a much quicker, efficient and reliable proposition. The road beyond Dibrugarh leads to the frontier parts of Arunachal Pradesh, with a fully functional advanced landing ground of Air Force at Walong, barely 100 km from the Chinese border. This was a theatre of armed incursion in 1962. Now access to one of the remotest border outposts in Anjaw has been made much easier. Bogibeel is poised to usher winds of change in this part of the world. However, the advantage of connectivity must be accompanied by an imaginative blueprint of economic development, drawing upon the region’s advantages. The symbolism of Bogibeel goes well beyond the Brahmaputra. The author is an IAS officer currently working with Government of Mizoram. Views are personal 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

52,"Lakhimpur violence: Only 4 out of 44 witnesses recorded, SC asks UP govt to take all statements","NEW DELHI:  Hauling up the UP Police for not recording statements of vulnerable witnesses in the Lakhimpur Kheri violence, the Supreme Court on Wednesday pulled it up for dilly-dallying and delaying the filing of the status report in the probe. Eight persons, including four farmers, were killed in the violence on October 3. “We think you are dragging your feet. Please dispel that impression,” observed a bench led by Chief Justice of India N V Ramana. The remarks came while perusing the UP government’s status report that was filed in a sealed cover just before the hearing. “We had expected it (report) yesterday and waited for it till late night,” the CJI told UP’s counsel, adding they hadn’t instructed filing it in a sealed cover.  ALSO READ | Lakhimpur Kheri violence: 'Rail roko' affects 150 locations in Northern Railway zone, 60 trains affected In the past, the court had faced criticism for the sealed cover procedure in sensitive cases like the Rafale scam.  During the hearing, the bench asked as to why the police had recorded statements of only four out of 44 witnesses under Section 164 of the CrPC. “This statement (164 CrPC) has more evidentiary value; why haven’t you recorded them? Statement before police will not lead anywhere,” Justice Suryakant said. Senior advocate Harish Salve, who also represented UP, claimed the probe into the killing of farmers was still on and the process to record statements is ongoing. He said the police had recorded two FIRs — one related to the murder case allegedly involving the son of a Union minister after SUVs ploughed into farmers in the village, and the other in which the crowd lynched and killed those who were in the cars. ALSO READ: SIT releases photos of six suspects Salve said 10 people have been arrested in connection with the farmers’ killing, of which four are still in police custody. Saying it was only concerned with the attack on farmers, the bench asked whether the accused were taken into police custody. The counsel said prior to being sent to jail, the six accused were in police custody for three days.

53,Lakhimpur Kheri case: SIT releases 6 photos of lynching suspects announce ‘rewards’ for info,"LUCKNOW: While probing into the mowing down of four farmers in the Lahikmpur Kheri violence case, the special investigation team (SIT) of UP Polie released six photographs of suspects who had allegedly ‘lynched’ three BJP workers after the farmers’ death on October 3.  It has also announced cash rewards -- without mentioning the amount --for information about the suspects and assured that the identity of the informers will be protected.  The pictures released by the SIT show a few men with sticks and black flags in their hands near burning vehicles. The SIT said sharing the pictures may amount to violation of rights and something that may put these men at risk.  As per the highly placed sources, police are trying to ascertain the nature of the attack on the convoy led by MoS Ajay Mishra’s son Ashish Mishra. Primarily, the SIT wants to establish if the attack on the convoy was ‘intentional or an act of retaliation. SN Sabat, additional director general (Lucknow zone), however, said, “It is a legal process which we normally follow in all other cases as well.” As per the sources, among the photos, while some faces are local, others may be from adjoining districts including Pilibhit and Bahraich, etc. The sources also claimed that the photos were taken out from the video clips which the SIT got from various sources. “Both the FIRs are under scanner. After the release of photos, witnesses have started arriving at the crime branch office to record their statements. Around five witnesses recorded their statements on Wednesday,” said Upendra Agarwal, DIG heading the SIT.",newsexp,R,,,,,
54,Supreme Court to hear Lakhimpur Kheri matter on October 20,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear on Wednesday the matter pertaining to the October 3 violence in Lakhimpur Kheri in which eight persons, including four farmers, were killed during a farmers' protest. A bench comprising Chief Justice N V Ramana and Justices Surya Kant and Hima Kohli, which had on October 8 expressed dissatisfaction over the steps taken by the Uttar Pradesh government in the ""brutal"" murder of eight persons, would hear the matter.  Ten people, including Union Minister of State for Home Ajay Mishra's son Ashish Mishra, have been arrested so far in connection with the case. The top court is hearing the matter after two lawyers had written a letter to the CJI seeking a high-level judicial inquiry, also involving the CBI, into the incident. Four farmers were mowed down by an SUV in Lakhimpur Kheri when a group agitating against the Centre's three new farm laws was holding a demonstration against the visit of Uttar Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya on October 3. Two BJP workers and a driver were beaten to death allegedly by the angry protesters, while a local journalist was also killed in the violence. Several farmer organisations are protesting against the passage of three laws -- The Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 and Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 since last November. The apex court had stayed the implementation of these laws in January. Initially, the protests started from Punjab in November last year and later spread to Delhi, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh While hearing the matter on October 8, the apex court had questioned the Uttar Pradesh government over the non-arrest of all the accused and had directed preservation of evidence. The bench had said, ""the law must take its course against all accused"" and ""the government has to take all remedial steps in this regard to inspire confidence"" in the investigation of ""brutal murder of eight persons"". The counsel appearing for the state government had assured the top court on October 8 that all appropriate action would be taken in the case.",newsexp,R,,,,,
55,"Lakhimpur, a question of human dignity","A local court in Lakhimpur in Uttar Pradesh has rejected the bail plea of Ashish Mishra, son of Union Minister Ajay Mishra, in the case over the murder of four farmers and a journalist. A few have been arrested in connection with the incident. The allegation is that the farmers and the journalist were killed by a convoy that deliberately ran over them and the accused had caused it. The video of the scene has shocked our mass conscience. The fact that a few BJP workers too were killed is quite sad and perturbing. After the incident, the UP Law Minister Brajesh Pathak visited the families of the BJP workers, while not caring to meet the families of the farmers who lost their lives. An elected government and the ministers running it must act in terms of the Constitution and not merely based on their political beliefs or inclinations. Such an ethical metamorphosis is an imperative, given the letter and spirit of the oath that a minister takes as per the Constitution. Jawaharlal Nehru, on the eve of Independence, opined that after the country attains freedom, though there would be a Congress government, it won’t be controlled by leaders of the Congress Party. This distinction should apply to every dispensation, irrespective of its political colour.  However, during the time of democratic crisis, this fine division becomes blurred, and the very government gets identified with the political party. Worse, even the political parties get reduced to an individual and the individual is glorified and equalised with the nation. Recall the slogan “India is Indira; Indira is India” formulated by D K Barooah, the Congress leader, prior to the Emergency (1975–77). At present, political idolatry is re-emerging in the country. It leads to a situation where Cabinet ministers act merely as political leaders with partisan interest, as it occurred with the UP law minister. This is an indication of democratic degeneration. Tarunabh Khaitan of Oxford University says that right from 2014, the Central government “consistently sought to erase the distinction between the party and the state by incrementally, but systemically, seeking to undermine or capture mechanisms that seek executive accountability”. A reflection of the process is also discernible in states like UP, Assam and Gujarat. A significant impact of this democratic destabilisation is clearly manifested in the uprooting of rule of law in such states. The Lakhimpur incident narrates a changed idea of law enforcement that negates the tenets of constitutionalism. It tells us about much more than mere criminalisation of politics. It was in the Manoj Narula case (2014) that the Supreme Court said that “criminalisation of politics is an anathema to the sacredness of democracy”. In the judgment, the court emphasised the significance of constitutional morality and good governance. The court said: “The faith of the people is embedded in the root of the idea of good governance which means reverence for citizenry rights, respect for fundamental rights and statutory rights in any governmental action, deference for unwritten constitutional values, veneration for institutional integrity, and inculcation of accountability to the collective at large.” The Lakhimpur episode, along with several other incidents ranging from Unnao to Hathras, not only shows the increasing crime rate in UP, but also the regime’s attitude towards it. According to a report by the National Crime Records Bureau, UP has recorded the highest number of murder cases in India (3,779) in 2020. Process of law often takes a back seat. It required the admonition of the top court even for arresting the accused in the Lakhimpur incident. It is in the very same state that journalists are arrested and incarcerated for doing their job, by invoking draconian laws like the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. Those who protested the Citizenship Amendment Act and the farm laws too had to face a similar predicament. False encounter killings and vigilantism has become the new normal. Almost every gathering of people with an agitational gesture was labelled unlawful, with Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code invoked. Activist Harsh Mander has pointed out that out of 139 persons jailed in 2020 under the National Security Act, 76 were accused of cow slaughter. Alleging ‘love jihad’, many couples were arrested. The state that instigated or abetted or justified heinous crimes like murder and rape was keen to brand personal intimacy a serious offence. Selective use or misuse or non-use of law, in accordance with the temporal requirement of those in power, is the new UP brand of justice. States like Assam and Tripura followed suit. Recall the killing of two people in police firing in Darrang district in Assam. The video of the official photographer thrashing the corpse of a man points to the situation in our troubled times. There is no human dignity without true democracy. As jurist Ronald Dworkin opined, “equal concern and respect” are the hallmarks of rule of law. Liberty, equality and fraternity are non-negotiable facets of egalitarianism. In constitutional democracies, rule of law rejects arbitrariness of power, as classically explained by the jurist A V Dicey. The law should be always above the politics of the day. However, in the UP model, the law is only an instrument of political power. Lakhimpur speaks volumes about the failure of a legal system, and of politics along with it. Kaleeswaram Raj

61,Lakhimpur Kheri violence: Cong slams PM Modi for not removing Union minister despite son's arrest,"NEW DELHI: The Congress on Saturday said the ""brutal"" mowing down of farmers in Lakhimpur Kheri was a manifestation of the government's continuing ""arrogance"" and slammed Prime Minister Narendra Modi for not removing the Union minister whose son has been arrested in connection with the incident. The Congress Working Committee (CWC), the party's highest decision-making body, in a resolution alleged that the last seven years have witnessed a ""diabolical design"" to attack the livelihood of 'annadatas' and landless farm labourers.  Referring to the October 3 Lakhimpur Kheri violence in which eight people died, four of them farmers allegedly knocked down by a vehicle carrying BJP workers, the CWC said that ""the brutal mowing down of farmers is a manifestation of the continuing arrogance"". ""This incident was preceded by the Union minister (of state) for home affairs, himself an accused in a case of murder in which the high court has reserved judgment for 43 months, publicly threatening the farmers with dire consequences, while flaunting his own dubious antecedents,"" the Congress said. Despite his son having been accused and arrested under relentless public pressure, Prime Minister Narendra Modi ""shamelessly"" refuses to remove Ajay Mishra as Union minister of state for home affairs, it said. On October 3, after the four farmers were knocked down, infuriated people then allegedly lynched some people in the vehicles. The other dead included two BJP workers and their driver. In the incident, a journalist was also killed. Farmers claimed that Union Minister Ajay Mishra's son Ashish Mishra was in one of the vehicles, an allegation denied by him and his father who say they can produce evidence to prove he was at an event at that time. Ashish Mishra 'Monu' was arrested in the case on October 9 after 12 hours of questioning, and a court has accepted his police custody from October 12 to October 15. In its resolution, the Congress said it is committed to the repeal of the three farm laws and ensuring a just and fair minimum support price mechanism for India's farmers as well as justice for landless farm labourers. ""We reiterate our continued resolve to fight this battle alongside farmers and farm labourers to defeat the Modi government's deliberate attack on India's 'annadatas',"" the CWC said. The party alleged that the ""attack"" on farmers began with a sinister design to deny the land acquisition compensation guaranteed by the Congress led-UPA through an Act of Parliament. This was followed by a refusal to provide any form of relief from agricultural indebtedness, a dilution of the norms for crop compensation and the framing of a convoluted crop insurance scheme which singularly benefitted select insurance companies instead of the suffering farmers, the resolution said. Agriculture was subjected to unjustifiable levels of taxation by imposing Goods and Services Tax (GST) on fertiliser (five per cent), pesticides (18 per cent) and tractors and agricultural equipment (12 per cent-18 per cent), it said. Meanwhile, fertilizer, seed and pesticide prices skyrocketed, the resolution pointed out. This was compounded by astronomical increase in diesel prices that are touching an unprecedented Rs 100 per litre and have even surpassed the Rs 100 per litre mark in several cities across the country, the resolution said. All these retrograde and outright anti-farmer measures, including excessive taxation by the Modi government, have placed an additional burden of Rs. 20,000-25,000 per hectare on agriculture, it claimed. ""The plight of India's farmers can be gauged from the NSSO report, which highlights that the average income per day of the small and marginal farmer is a pittance of Rs 26.67/ day. And the average debt is Rs 72,000 per farmer. The average income per day is way below even the minimum daily wage for labour,"" the resolution stated. For over ten and a half months, lakhs of farmers have been protesting peacefully on Delhi's borders, blocked by spikes and boulders on the national highway from advancing further, it said. The CWC also noted the ""courage and consistency"" with which Rahul Gandhi has fought for the cause of farmers and the ""resilience"" of Priyanka Gandhi Vadra in fighting the onslaught on farmers in Uttar Pradesh. In another resolution on the political situation in the country, the CWC said the tragic incident at Lakhimpur Kheri is a clear example of official support to the attempt to suppress the voice of the farmers. The refusal of the prime minister to condemn the brutal murder of the farmers and to sack the minister of state for home affairs have shocked the conscience of the country, it said.",newsexp,R,,,,,

71,"Farmers' killing in Lakhimpur 'absolutely condemnable', says Nirmala Sitharaman in US","BOSTON: The Lakhimpur Kheri violence, in which four farmers were killed, is ""absolutely condemnable,"" Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has said, emphasising that there are issues of such nature happening in other parts of India equally which should be raised ""when they happen and not when it suits others"" because there is a BJP government in Uttar Pradesh. Sitharaman, who is on an official visit to the US, was responding to a question during a conversation at Harvard Kennedy School on Tuesday about the killing of four farmers in Lakhimpur Kheri and the arrest of Ashish Mishra, son of Union Minister of State for Home Ajay Mishra.  She was asked why there is no word on this from the prime minister, senior ministers and why there is a ""defensive reaction"" when somebody asks questions about such things. ""No, absolutely not....It's nice of you to have picked up that one incident which is absolutely condemnable, every one of us say that. Equally there are instances happening elsewhere, is my concern."" VIEW GALLERY | 'Fascism', 'Jallianwala Bagh', 'Hitler': Lakhimpur Kheri farmers' killing leads to strong reactions by Opposition leaders ""India has issues of such nature happening in very many different parts of the country equally. I would like you, and many others, including Dr Amartya Sen, who all know India, to raise it at every time when it happens, not just raise it when it suits us because it's a state where BJP is in power, one of my cabinet colleague's son is in probably trouble, and also assume that it's actually them who did it and not anybody else. Due course of justice will also have a complete inquiry process to establish it,"" she said. ""And it's not being defensive about my party or my Prime Minister. It's being defensive about India. I will talk for India, I will talk for justice for the poor. I will not be mocked at. And if it is mocking, I will be defensive to stand up and say 'Sorry, let's talk on facts'. That's my answer for you,"" she said. Ashish Mishra was named in an FIR following allegations that he was in one of the vehicles that mowed down four farmers protesting over UP Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya's visit on October 3. To a question on the farmers' protests, Sitharaman said that the three acts which the government brought in were discussed by the various parliamentary committees over a decade. She said all the three acts have been discussed variously by the State governments, by the Center after the BJP came into power in 2014. ""This has been in the making for a decade now. Every stakeholder has been consulted,"" she said. ""When the farm laws were brought in the Lok Sabha, there was an elaborate discussion and the agriculture minister gave his reply as well. It was only when it came to the Rajya Sabha, there was a lot of noise and disturbance,"" she said. Thousands of farmers from Punjab, Haryana and several other states have been protesting on various borders of Delhi since November 26 last year, seeking repeal of three farm laws enacted in September. Dubbing these laws as ""anti-farmer"", these farmers claim that the newly enacted legislations would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the ""mercy"" of big corporations. Sitharaman said the protesters belong to one state and some parts of other states - ""Punjab, Haryana and some parts of western Uttar Pradesh."" She said the government has been saying that it is willing to talk with the protesters and has been engaging with them. The government has asked pointedly what is that one aspect in any one of the three laws which have been passed to which the protesters object, she said. ""We are willing to talk about it, tell us that one particular aspect in any one of the three laws. Till date, we have not had even one particular aspect which is being questioned. And therefore, the protesters are not sure on what score they are protesting, what is it that they are objecting."" ""Then there's this issue about the minimum support price to be given to farmers,"" she said, adding that the MSP are announced well in time and the farmers can decide whether they want to grow a crop or not and they can otherwise choose to grow something else. She said once the farmers choose to grow any of these, for which a minimum support price is announced and procurements are done, through direct benefit transfer using technology, money is deposited as a lump sum into their accounts. ""The highest amount of procurement, the largest ever payment per farmer under the minimum support price which is declared has happened in the last seven years after Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi has come. Highest ever."" ""The number of farmers, the total quantum of money, total quantum of grain procured in each one of them - the highest as has happened season after season in the last seven years,"" she said. Highlighting that there are recorded conversations ""which you can see of farmers even from Punjab, even from Haryana"", she said farmers have got the entire amount into their account. ""This is verifiable, not a claim which I'm making. You can go and check it out. Highest amount and the entire amount is given into the account directly the day after procurement is done. No staggering, no delaying,"" she said. ""So we have not been told what it is that they're protesting against as yet and the minister is willing to talk even today.""",newsexp,R,,,,,
